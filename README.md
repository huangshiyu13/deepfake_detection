# Deepfake Detection

This repo will not be updated. We will public our new version at https://github.com/TARTRL/Deepfake_Dection

## Description

Use deep models to detect fake images. 

We trained an EfficientNet model to detect deepfake images. 
Check out this [repo](https://github.com/EndlessSora/DeeperForensics-1.0) 
to know more about deepfake images.

- Fake image:

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Pytroch

## Usage

- ### test images using trained model

You need download the pretrained model from BaiduYun:

download link: `https://pan.baidu.com/s/16NIV5BVUITKwolQzPbj9Zw`  password:`r3i8`

And put the model(`model_half.pth.tar`) 
under `./models`. Then you can run python script as below:

`python test_images.py ./test_images/0.png ./test_images/1.jpeg`

- ### train on your own dataset

The training code is to be released.
